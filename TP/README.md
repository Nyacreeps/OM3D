### Goals

* Occlusion Culling : occlusion query on previous frame
* TAA : need moving object to be verified
  1. [x] Implement Halton (2,3) 2D sequence (length 16) for jitter
  2. [x] Make rendering fill velocity buffer (during g-buffer pass)
  3. [x] History buffer
  4. [x] Blend between frames
  5. [x] Add jitter
  6. [ ] Ensure moving objects have no ghosting
  7. [x] ???
  8. [x] Profit ?
